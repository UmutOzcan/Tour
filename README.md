## Project Details

Tour is a travel agency site.

MSSQL as database; For the UI, I used W3Layouts Bootstrap, which include HTML, CSS and JS. The site I developed on the back-end side was developed with .Net 6.0. Entity Framework Core development approach and Repository Design Pattern were used. MVC and N-Tier Architecture were used.

Users can book the tour they want. They can also log in, add comments, or learn about the experiences of other users and guides.

## The Technologies and Approaches Used are as follows

- .Net 6.0
- MSSQL
- Bootstrap
- JS
- Entity Framework Core
- Repository Design Pattern
- MVC
- N-Tier Architecture
