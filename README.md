# Tour Travel Agency Website

Tour is a travel agency site. 

MSSQL as database; For the front-end, I used W3Layouts, which includes HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The site I developed on the back-end side was developed with .Net 6.0. Entity Framework Core development approach and Repository Design Pattern were used. MVC and N-Tier Architecture were used.

Users can book the tour they want. They can also log in, add comments, or learn about the experiences of other users and guides.


### The Technologies and Approaches Used are as follows:

- .Net 6.0
- MSSQL
- JS
- Entity Framework Core
- Repository Design Pattern
- MVC
- N-Tier Architecture

Still Being Developed
